Includes **1735 annotated examples**, a data visualizer, training and evaluation scripts for spaCy and pretrained tok2vec weights.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [`ner-drugs`](ner-drugs)                       | Use word vectors to boostrap an NER model to detect drug names in Reddit comments. Includes **1977 annotated examples**, a data visualizer, training and evaluation scripts for spaCy and pretrained tok2vec weights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [`textcat-docs-issues`](textcat-docs-issues)   | Train a binary text classifier with exclusive classes to predict whether a GitHub issue title is about documentation. Includes **1161 annotated examples**, a live demo and downloadable model and training and evaluation scripts for spaCy.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
